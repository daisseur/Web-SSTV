    <h4>About:</h4>
    <p>Web SSTV aims to both encode and decode SSTV using svelte and Web Audio API. Web SSTV can be run entirely offline (without styling), and on any platform from Chromebooks to phones, so long as they support JavaScript and Web Audio. By making SSTV readily available on many platforms, we aim to create educational opportunities and introduce more people to STEM and amateur radio.</p>
